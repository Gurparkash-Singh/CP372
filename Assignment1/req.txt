Each packet contains a header and data
8 bytes for header
    4 bytes for data length
    2 bytes for pcode (pcode for phase 1 = 0)
    2 bytes for entity (Server = 2 Client = 1)
Data must be divisible by 4

Server closes connection if:
    1. If the server does not receive any packet from the client for 3 seconds.
    2. If a packet arrives with a size that is not divisible by 4.
    3. If any of the packet's length, data length, data, pcode or entity values
       do not match the expectation for the specific phase of the protocol.
    4. If unsigned short or unsigned integer numbers are not used as required.
    5. If the characters are not properly aligned in network order (big-endian)


Phase 1
Server initiates on PORT 12000 UDP and listens to incoming packets
